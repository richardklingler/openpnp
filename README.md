## My OpenPnP pick and place machine stuff

This is a place where a publish all my work building a pick and place machine including mechanics, electronics, Marlin firmware modifications and 3D printed designs.

The machine is driven by the excellent and open sourced [OpenPNP software](http://openpnp.org).

### Sponsoring

All required hardware is financed with my low little budget, so every donation is very welcome, either through the Patreon link on the side or through Paypal Me:

Currently work is on hold due to missing funds.

### Things to do

This is still a work-in-progress project, so not everything is either published or at final stage. Currently following tasks are ongoing:

#### Z-axis rework

Currently the Z-axis uses Igus slider which are showing high tolerances when pushed/pulled in Y direction. The rails will be therefore replaced with dual MGN9 rails with 2 carriages each for better stability/accuracy. A dual rail design could then also be used for a dual-nozzle setup.

#### X-axis rework

Also the Igus rails on the X-axis are unacceptable. Seems Igus rails are only halfway usable when lying flat, just like for the Y-axis. The new X-axis will use two MGN9 rails, one on top and one at the bottom of the X-axis profile.
